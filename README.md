# Exploring Real Estate Trends
## Description
Our project aims to understand trends in the real estate market using a dataset collected from the READTING website. We aim to provide a better perspective for people looking to own property by helping them compare prices between countries and assess property sizes.

## Dataset
The dataset we worked on was collected from [this website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/toriqulstu/worlds-real-estate-data147k) and consists of 14 columns and 147,000 rows. It is a valuable collection of real estate information sourced from REALTING.com, an international affiliate sales system known for facilitating safe and convenient property transactions worldwide. [REALTING.com](https://realting.com/) has a strong foundation, with its founders bringing approximately 20 years of experience in developing information technologies for the real estate market. This dataset provides insights into various properties across the globe, making it a valuable resource for real estate market analysis, property valuation, and trend prediction.


## Analysis
### Top 5 Countries with the Most Listed Real Estate
Our first analysis focuses on the most frequently occurring country in the website dataset. We found that Turkey appears the most, accounting for 17.2% of the total listings. This suggests that Turkey has the highest number of real estate opportunities. Following Turkey, Hungary and Russia rank next, with 15.9% and 13.2%, respectively.

### Correlation Analysis
From our analysis, we found that the strongest correlation among factors is total area, with a correlation coefficient of 0.6. Next in significance are apartment rooms, followed by apartment bathrooms. However, we observed that building total floors does not correlate with price.

### Average Prices Among Countries
As we examined price trends, we found that Italy has the highest average property price at $1,474,302 USD, followed by the UAE at $1,187,211 USD.
Conversely, the countries with the lowest average prices are Belarus at $71,556 USD and Georgia at $93,673 USD.
